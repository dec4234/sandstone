# Client Login Example
This is an example of a client that connects to a Minecraft server and performs the login procedure.

Requirements:
- Minecraft server running on `localhost:25565` AKA `127.0.0.1:25565`
- Server should be running with online mode disabled (i.e. `online-mode=false` in `server.properties`)
- Server should disable compression (i.e. `compression-threshold=-1` in `server.properties`)
